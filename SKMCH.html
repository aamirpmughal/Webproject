          Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre
        </h2>
        <!-- https://shaukatkhanum.org.pk/ -->
        <p>
          The hospital was founded by Imran Khan, Pakistani
          cricketer-turned-politician and former Prime Minister. The inspiration
          to build a cancer hospital came after his mother, Mrs. Shaukat Khanum,
          succumbed to cancer in 1985. During his mother's illness, he also
          witnessed the plight of poor cancer patients in Pakistan's hospitals,
          and deeply felt the need for a specialized cancer centre in his
          country. He had a vision of making cancer treatment accessible to
          every Pakistani who needed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since its opening, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, Lahore has
          received local and international recognition, including the Joint
          Commission International's Gold Seal of Approval and the World Health
          Organization's UAE Foundation Prize.
        </p>

        <p>
          The second hospital was inaugurated on 29 December 2015 by a cancer
          patient in Peshawar. At the completion of Phase I, it has commenced
          clinical services, with outpatient clinics, inpatient beds, a fully
          equipped intensive care unit (ICU), a full-service pharmacy, and
          24-hour emergency services. Chemotherapy services are also available,
          of tremendous benefit to patients who previously made physically,
          emotionally, and financially demanding trips to Lahore for cyclical
          chemotherapy treatments every few weeks.

        <!-- NAMAL University Details -->
        <h2 id="namal">NAMAL University</h2>
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namal_Institute -->
        <p>
          The Institute is located on 30 km, Talagang Mianwali Road near Namal
          Lake. Initially, it was established as an affiliated college of the
          University of Bradford, UK. Later in 2019 Namal College acquired a DAI
          (Degree Awarding Institute) status and thus became Namal Institute.[4]
          Imran Khan is the chairman of Board of Governors Namal Education
          Foundation which is the sponsoring body of Namal Knowledge City
          including this institute. The initial 40 kanal of land area for this
          institute was provided by a local resident Ghulam Muhammad Seelu. Now
          it has more than 1000 acres of land overlooking the Namal Lake. There
          are more than 300 students studying in this institute for whom more
          than 90% are on financial support
